<h1>Movie API Project</h1>
<p>Welcome to the Movie API project repository! This project is a simple React application designed to interact with a movie API. It includes routing, notifications via Toastify, and data fetching with Axios. The primary goal of this project was to serve as a learning playground to explore React and get familiar with its capabilities.</p>

<p>Although this project is relatively basic, it has been a valuable way to dive into a new language and understand its core features. I deployed it on Netlify, allowing me to experiment with the deployment process and test the app live: <a href="https://app.netlify.com/sites/prime-flix-dc/">Prime Flix DC on Netlify</a>.</p>

<p>This project has inspired me to continue my React journey.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>API Integration:</strong> Fetches movie data from an external API using Axios.</li>
    <li><strong>Routing:</strong> Utilizes React Router for navigation between different pages.</li>
    <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> Implements Toastify to display notifications to users.</li>
    <li><strong>Responsive Design:</strong> The application is designed to be responsive and user-friendly.</li>
    <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> Stores user-selected favorites in the browser's Local Storage, allowing users to retain their selections even after refreshing the page.</li>
    <li><strong>State Management:</strong> Uses `setState` for managing component state, ensuring dynamic updates to the interface.</li>
    <li><strong>React Hooks:</strong> Utilizes hooks such as `useEffect` to handle side effects (like data fetching) and `useParams` to capture route parameters, making the application more interactive and functional.</li>
